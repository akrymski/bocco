# Your Title
Howdy, this is your [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).

It's designed to be a really **simple** wiki that *doesn't get in your way*.  The layout was inspired by documentation projects like [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)

## Features

### Table of Contents
The table of contents on the left is automatically generated from your markdown.

### Responsive
Works on devices of various sizes

## Markdown
### Code `new Class([options])`
Source code is automatically syntax-highlighted when indented with 4 spaces:

    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      alert(i);
    }

Or using the alternative [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) syntax.

### Tables
Tables can be displayed like this:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

### Lists
Lists are trivial:

- this
- that

Or numeric:

1. one
2. two

### Horizontal rules

### Quotes

> This entire paragraph of text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element.
Blockquote elements are reflowable. You may arbitrarily
wrap the text to your liking, and it will all be parsed
into a single blockquote element.

### HTML

You can also embed any HTML you like, for example here's a button:

<a href="http://enterprisewiki.co" class="button">Link to Homepage</a>
